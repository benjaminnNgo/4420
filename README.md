# Geometric Data Structures: From Theory to Application

This project implements 2 geometric data structures, KD-tree[1] and Ball* Tree[2] and benchmarks their performance on various datasets. For a complete discussion about our project, please see our [Report](./document/Report.pdf).


## Installation

For detailed information about the required packages and environment setup, please see the [Environment Setup Documentation](./document/Environment_Setup.md).


## Repository Folder Structure

A detailed explanation of the project's directory structure is available [here](./document/Respository_Architecture.md).


Further information about how to conduct experiments is described in [Experiments instruction](./document/Experiments_instructions.md).
